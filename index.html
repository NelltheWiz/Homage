        <li><span class="bold">1949 - </span>Valerie's interest in science began when she'd watch her father tinkering with the television and seeing all the mechanical parts inside the TV.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1951 - </span>At the tender age of eight, Valerie read "The Boys' First Book on Electronics" which sparked her interest in a career in science.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1964 - </span>Graduated from Morgan State University, majored in Physics(one of only two women in the program)</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1964 - </span>Began working at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center as a data analyst.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1970 - </span>Developed real-time computer data systems to support satellite operations control centers</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1974 - </span>Led a team of approximately 50 people for the Large Area Crop Inventory Experiment (LACIE), a joint effort with NASA's Johnson Space Center, NOAA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1976 - </span>Attended a science exhibition that included an illusion of a light bulb that appeared to be lit, even though it had been removed from its socket. This inspired her to begin researching optical illusions.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1977 - </span>Began experimenting with concave mirrors to create optical illusions, leading to her invention of the illusion transmitter.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1980 - </span>On October 21st, Valerie received a patent for the illusion transmitter, a device that creates 3D illusions using concave mirrors.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1986 - </span>Until 1990 Valerie served as the Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) project manager, during which SPAN underwent a major reconfiguration and expanded from approximately 100 computer nodes to about 2,700 worldwide.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1990 - </span>SPAN became a major part of NASA's science networking and today's Internet.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">1995 - </span>Retired from NASA at the end of August, concluding her service as associate chief of the Space Science Data Operations Office, manager of the NASA Automated Systems Incident Response Capability, and chair of the Space Science Data Operations Office Education Committee.
